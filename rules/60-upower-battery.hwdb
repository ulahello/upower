#
# The lookup keys are composed in:
#   60-upower-battery.rules
#
# Match string format:
# battery:<kernel>:<model_name>:dmi:<dmi pattern>
#
# The kernel is the name of battery in /sys/class/power_supply for
# differentiating between multiple batteries.
#
# The model_name is battery model name in for example
# /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/model_name.
#
# The full DMI string of the running machine can be read from
#   /sys/class/dmi/id/modalias
# That requires a kernel built with CONFIG_DMIID set, which is common.
# The full DMI string is not needed here and the meaning of individual parts
# can be seen in the source of the DMIID kernel module
#   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/firmware/dmi-id.c
#
# To add local overrides, create a new file
# /etc/udev/hwdb.d/61-battery-local.hwdb
# and add your rules there. To load the new rules execute (as root):
# systemd-hwdb  update
# udevadm trigger -v -p /sys/class/power_supply/BAT
# where BAT is the battery in question.
